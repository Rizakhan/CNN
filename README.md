# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
I trained a cnn and used transfer learning to recognize different dog species using the Inception Architecture MY final test accuracy was 82% which could be improved by increasing iterations for the Inception model

2. In this project I used the skills I developed in the first project to implement a deep learning model that can classify different kinds of skin cancer lesions using deep learning

3.cats vs dogs 
(To further see what transfer learning is capable of I used the kaggle dataset cats vs dogs, The year it was released it used 12,500 photos of cats and 12,500 photos of dogs but with the recent advancement in computer vision It needs only 1000 photos to give an accuracy of over 90%
